                           Plants are living beings that produce the oxygen we breathe.<br/>
                           they maintain the soil, allow us to create medicines with them and
                           contribute to climate stability. <br>
                           Those would be one of the reasons to take care of them, <br>
                           since we would not only be caring for and protecting a living being, <br>
                           but we would also be benefiting from its attributes.

                    <h4>What are the benefits of having plants at home?</h4>
                    <div class="text2 y">
                        <p>
                           There are a huge variety of benefits to having plants at home. I am going to mention some of them. <br>
                           One of its main benefits of plants is being able to extract food from them, <br>
                           such as tomato plants, grapes, beets, etc. <br>
                           At the same time, plants help us disconnect from stress and/or negative thoughts that <br> 
                           we have by concentrating on their care, we will find it pleasant. <br/>
                           Finally, it is more recommended for a house with a high percentage of humidity that there are plants in it, <br>
                           because they help regulate humidity.

                        <p>
                            Peace Lilies are not really Lilies. They are tropical plants of the Arum family, <br> native to areas of Central and South America. <br>
                            Its care is simple and fun, causing a beautiful result. <br> They are not cold hardy plants, so they should be grown in hot, humid climates. <br>
                            These plants can grow up to 16 inches, so grow larger than your pot and you would have to use a container twice its size. <br>
                            Lilies can't stand being dry that long so keep the soil moist every 2-3 days and repot the plant every few years in the spring. <br>
                            They should be in bright, indirect sunlight and kept out of areas that receive sunlight all day. <br>
                            One quality they have is that they will let you know when they are thirsty. The leaves would begin to fall. <br>
                            To encourage growth during winter, fertilize the plant every 6 weeks or less. <br>
                            Finally, Peace Lilies tend to collect too much dust in the home. Wipe gently with a damp paper towel every week, <br> 
                            otherwise a thick layer of dust could inhibit photosynthesis.

                                It is a plant that demands good humidity in the environment to keep its leaves healthy. 
                                A compelling reason to spray them with non-calcareous water, and preventing them from getting soaked.

                                the humidity that it needs must be constantly provided.

                                particularly the earlier sections Tsutsusi and Pentanthera. 
                                Azaleas bloom in spring and their flowers usually last for several weeks. 
                                Shade tolerant, they prefer to live near or under trees. 
                                They are part of the Ericaceae family.they require a lot of humidity. 
                                Therefore, they must be watered daily by adding water to a plate. 
                                Let the roots get the water they need for 5-10 minutes. 
                                It is important not to use very hard water, it must be filtered or rainwater.

It is native to northern Europe, which limits its distribution to marshes, estuaries and sometimes in brackish places. A bright location is essential for its flowering with fertile soil and good drainage, it also needs a regular subscriber, important for its development. We must consider what is necessary to give the substrate the necessary humidity to develop, since it does not demand a high consumption of water. In fact, it does not tolerate excess water or stagnation.

                                Its scientific name is Dracaena fragrans.
                                Originally from Madagascar and known for its red sap, 
                                this strain not only has great lines and vivid colours, but is also very easy to care for.
                                It needs good lighting; warm and stable temperature; specific substrate;
                                moderate watering and environmental humidity, two of the most delicate cares for this plant.
                                This one prefers its soil to dry out slightly between waterings. 
                                When the soil stays too wet or too dry, you'll probably see brown tips on the leaves. 
                                If the top is dry, then your plant is ready to drink.

                            <p class="m">Its scientific name is Bambusoideae.
                                The origin dates back about 40 million years, but its use dates back to approximately 5,000 BC, 
                                Neolithic of the Stone Age, in China, where the first products made of bamboo appear, 
                                such as arrows or construction materials.
                                Bamboo should be watered twice a week in temperate climates, as it needs large amounts of water to grow. 
                                However, it is important to take care not to drown the roots. 
                                In the case of hot climates, watering should be three to four times a week.

                                Its scientific name is Bougainvillea.
                                This thorny shrub or tree is native to South America, mainly Brazil and Peru. 
                                It is currently cultivated as an ornamental plant in various subtropical and tropical regions of the world.
                                During the winter, the ideal is that it is watered with rainwater or, indoors, 
                                that we leave it at rest; during the summer it will not be excessively demanding: 
                                a weekly watering will suffice if it is planted directly in the ground, 
                                and a couple of weekly waterings if it is in a pot.

                        Its scientific name is Laceleaf. Anthurium is a genus of around 1000 species of flowering plants, the largest genus in the Arum family, Araceae.It is a plant that demands good humidity in the environment to keep its leaves healthy. A compelling reason to spray them with non-calcareous water, and preventing them from getting soaked. Whether we live in a dry climate or during the winter months, the humidity that it needs must be constantly provided.

                        Su nombre científico es Laceleaf. Anturio es un género de alrededor de 1000 especies de plantas con flores, el género más grande de la familia Arum, Araceae. Es una planta que exige buena humedad en el ambiente para mantener sus hojas saludables. Un motivo de peso para rociarlas con agua no calcárea, y evitar que se empapen. Tanto si vivimos en un clima seco como durante los meses de invierno, hay que proporcionarle constantemente la humedad que necesita.
